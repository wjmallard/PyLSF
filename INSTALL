Installing PyLSF
================

To build the module,
find out where your LSF libraries and headers are stored.
For example:

```bash
$ which bsub
/lsf/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/bin/bsub
```

The libraries should be in ```/lsf/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/lib```,
and the headers should be in ```/lsf/7.0/include```.
Once you have this information,
use it to set ```library_dirs``` and ```include_dirs``` in ```setup.py```.
Then run the installer:

```bash
$ python setup.py build
$ mv build/lib.XYZ/PyLSF.so .
$ rm -rf build
```

Replace the XYZ with whatever version string appears there.

To use the module:
- Add the LSF lib directory to ```LD_LIBRARY_PATH```.
- Add the PyLSF directory to ```PYTHON_PATH```.
- from Python: ```>>> import PyLSF```
